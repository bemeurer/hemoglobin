# Contributing

1. File an issue describing a bug or intended feature.

1. Create a branch named `xx-<description>` where `xx` is the number of the issue your branch will address, and `<description>` is a brief human-readable description. For example, these contributing guidelines were proposed in [issue 25](https://github.com/bemeurer/hemoglobin/issues/25), so the branch was called `25-contributing`.

1. Add commits to your branch.

1. File a pull request.

1. A reviewer will review your pull request and note any needed changes. Once everything looks good, the pull request will be approved and merged.
